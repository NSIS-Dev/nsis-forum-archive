# nsis-forum-archive

You can't really use this without having any data (which is not public at this time), yet you can build and test this following these steps:

```sh
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/NSIS-Dev/nsis-forum-archive
cd nsis-forum-archive

# Install dependencies and build
yarn || npm install

# Run server at localhost:8080
npm start
```

That's it folks!
